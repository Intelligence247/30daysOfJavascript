// Error handling, "try...catch"

// The “try…catch” syntax
// The try...catch construct has two main blocks: try, and then catch:

// try {

//   // code...

// } catch (err) {

//   // error handling

// }

// How it works
// 1. First, the code in try {...} is executed.
// 2. If there were no errors, then catch (err) is ignored: the execution reaches the end of try and goes on, skipping catch.
